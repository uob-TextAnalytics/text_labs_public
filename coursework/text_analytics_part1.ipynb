Before you submit your notebook, please make sure this code has not been modified, then restart your kernel, clear all cell outputs, run all of your code once again, then save the notebook. \n",

    "## Marking guidelines:\n",
    "1. This notebook is worth 32% of the marks for the Text Analytics assignment.\n",
    "1. The number of marks for each task is shown alongside the task.\n",
    "1. We will evaluate the output of your code after running it, and marks will be awarded based on how well the output matches the task's instructions. \n",
    "1. We will give partial marks for incomplete or partially correct answers. \n",
    "1. We do not give additional marks for code style or comments, but clear code will help us to understand what you have done so that we can award partial marks where necessary. \n",
    "1. Unless the task asks you to implement something from scratch, there is no penalty for using software libraries in your implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main source of support will be during the lab sessions. The TAs and lecturers will help you with questions about the lectures, the code provided for you in this notebook, and general questions about the topics we cover. For the assessed tasks, they can only answer clarifying questions about what you have to do. Please email Edwin if you have any other queries edwin.simpson@bristol.ac.uk and/or post your query to the Teams channel for this unit.\n",

    "First we need to load the data. The data is already split into train, validation and test. The _validation_ set (also called 'development' set or 'devset') can be used to compute performance of your model when tuning hyperparameters, optimising combinations of features, or looking at the errors your model makes before improving it. This allows you to hold out the test set (i.e., not to look at it at all when developing your method) to give a fair evaluation of the model and how well it generalises to new examples. This avoids tuning the model to specific examples in the test set. An alternative approach to validation is to not use a single fixed validation set, but instead use [cross validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html). "
